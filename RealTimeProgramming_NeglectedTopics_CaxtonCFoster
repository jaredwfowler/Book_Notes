A lot of this stuff I already know, but it helps to write it down to re-enforce my long-term memory and understanding of these topics.

SINGLE INTERRUPTS
-I-bit: Interrupts Inhibit flip-flop. Simple flip-flop which is set to ignore other interrupts, normally when another interrupt is being handled.
-IRQVEC: A special space of memory in RAM, normally set up upon initialization.  When an interrupt occurrs, it has a pre-defined place to look for how to handle that interrupt in the IRQVEC (Interrupt Request Vector Table

EDGE VERSUS LEVEL
-Edge-Detecting-Line: Line gives off a "yelp" when the edge changes, either from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. If no one is listenting, it is possible to miss it completely.
-Level-Detecting-Line: Line acts more like a screaming child... it doesn't stop until someone pays attention to it. For this reason, IRQ's have to be of the Level-Detecting type.

-NMI: non-maskable-interrupt. Pays no attention to the interrupt inhibit bit. Some systems use this as the "power-up" interrupt causing the computer to execute some execution on power-up. In such a system, the IVEC for this intterupt, NMIVEC, must be in ROM, not RAM.

-Flip-Flops: There are several different types, but the commonality is that they all hold 1 bit of information, they normally all have 2 inputs and 2 outputs. The inputs determine whether to set or clear the bit. Output Q outputs the stored bit, and Q' is the compliment.
  There are several variants, which seem to be deferred by if the input lines are held high, lo, etc. 
  Generally in circuit schematics, when something is triggered at low, or is "active-low", it will have a circle drawn at point of connection.

The book contains an exercise at this point which I found interesting. I didn't do it, but I did look over the schematic. 
The problem was that we hade to wait for a physical action to occurr before we could proceed with the next portion of processing. In this case, a switch that was being toggled as a box went under it, and the switch wasn't released until the box made it past a certain point.
Instead of having the IRQ directly dependent on a single Flip-Flop and the external object that set it off, they use 2 flip-flops.
One to set the IRQ and then be turned off by the processor, and another to set that flip flop on the external object side.

PORTS
-Memory,CPU,I/O Devices. 
  -Sometimes there are separate busses, one between the Memory and CPU, and another between the CPU and the I/O's. 
  -Other times there is only one bus, where the memory and I/O devices are on the same bus.  
  -"Modern" computing normally uses the second method, and uses something called memory mapping. 
-Memory Mapping: I/O devices are assigned some location in main memory, which is reserved for that I/O.
